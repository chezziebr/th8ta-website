# TH8TA AI IMAGE GENERATION GUIDELINES

## Photography Style Bible
Version 1.0 | November 2025

---

## CORE PHILOSOPHY

TH8TA images should feel cohesive, sophisticated, and muted. The product and model are the focus—backgrounds are intentionally understated. When color appears, it's desaturated and warm. The overall effect should feel like a high-end fashion editorial meets recovery comfort.

**Key principle:** 80% of images use neutral studio/stone backgrounds. 20% use lifestyle environments (all with desaturated, cohesive color grading).

- Include "professional photography" for better quality

## FINAL NOTES

**Consistency is everything.** When someone scrolls through the TH8TA website, every image should feel like it belongs to the same visual family. The stone backgrounds, the muted lifestyle shots, the soft lighting—these create a cohesive brand world.

**The product is the color.** By keeping backgrounds neutral, the garment itself becomes the visual interest. An espresso brown jogger against stone gray reads as luxurious. The same jogger against a vibrant blue sky reads as athletic/sporty—not what we want.

**Recovery mood, not workout mode.** Every image should feel like the person is in recovery mode, not about to exercise or currently exercising. Relaxed posture, soft lighting, comfortable environments.
