# TH8TA BRAND POSITIONING v2
## "Everything After the Workout"

---

## THE ONE-LINER

**TH8TA is curated afterwear for endurance athletes—everything you wear when you're not working out, designed for bodies that do.**

---

## THE PROBLEM WE SOLVE

You've spent years building an athletic body. Lats that pull. Shoulders that carry. Quads that climb. Calves that don't quit.

And yet—nothing fits right.

Fashion brands design for average bodies. Athletic brands design for the workout. Nobody designs for the 22 hours a day when you're *not* training but still living in a body that trains.

**The gap:**
- Your favorite cashmere cardigan pulls across your shoulders
- "Relaxed fit" tanks still feel tight in the lats
- Leggings feel like your training tights (your brain can't relax)
- You end up in oversized everything because nothing else works

**The result:** You look like you gave up, or you look like you're about to work out. There's no in-between.

---

## WHAT TH8TA IS

We're the in-between.

TH8TA is a curated collection of afterwear—clothing designed for what you wear when you're *not* working out, but built for bodies that do.

**We are:**
- Tanks and tees with room for lats and shoulders
- Leggings so buttery soft your nervous system knows it's not workout time
- Cashmere that drapes over muscle without pulling
- Puffer boots that look chic but feel like recovery
- Cropped muscle tanks paired with pleated skirts
- Elevated loungewear that celebrates (not hides) athletic form

**We do the work so you don't have to.**

Think of us like Whole Foods did for organic. Instead of scouring every brand, reading every label, wondering if *this* piece will fit your shoulders or *that* legging will feel like rest—you just shop TH8TA. If it's here, it works.

---

## WHAT TH8TA IS NOT

- We're not activewear (you have enough of that)
- We're not athleisure (we hate that word)
- We're not another fashion brand with random clothes
- We're not oversized-everything because nothing else fits

---

## THE TH8TA DIFFERENCE

### 1. Built for Athletic Bodies
Every piece is selected or designed with endurance athletes in mind. Room in the shoulders. Space in the lats. Length in the torso. We fit the body you've built.

### 2. Signals Rest, Not Work
Your brain is smart. If it feels like workout clothes, you won't fully relax. Our fabrics are intentionally different—buttery, soft, unstructured—so your nervous system gets the memo: *you're off duty.*

### 3. Celebrates the Form
We don't hide your body under shapeless layers. We accentuate it. Athletic bodies are beautiful—the shoulders, the defined back, the strong legs. Our pieces show that off in everyday life.

### 4. Curated, Not Created (Mostly)
We scour the market for the best pieces that meet our standards. When we can't find it, we make it. Either way, if it's on TH8TA, it passed the test.

### 5. Pairing is Part of the Product
A cropped muscle tank with a pleated skirt. Cashmere joggers with structured sneakers. The combinations we suggest are as considered as the individual pieces. We help you dress like an athlete who has their shit together.

---

## WHO WE'RE FOR

**Primary:** Endurance athletes (runners, cyclists, triathletes, swimmers, OCR athletes) who:
- Train 6-15+ hours per week
- Have developed athletic physiques (broad shoulders, defined lats, strong legs)
- Struggle to find "normal" clothes that fit
- Want to look put-together without looking like they're headed to the gym
- Appreciate quality materials and thoughtful design
- Value their recovery time as much as their training time

**Secondary:** Anyone with an athletic build who's tired of the fit problem—CrossFit athletes, rowers, climbers, dancers, former college athletes who kept training.

**Psychographic:** People who take their sport seriously but don't take themselves too seriously. Confident, a little irreverent, appreciate wit and quality.

---

## BRAND VOICE

### Confident, Not Cocky
We know we're good. We don't need to shout it. We speak with quiet authority—the kind you earn from doing the work.

### Warm, Not Woo-Woo  
We care about recovery science, but we're not going to lecture you about parasympathetic activation. We're your friend who happens to know things, not your coach.

### Real, Not Rigid
We curse sometimes. We make jokes. We don't take ourselves too seriously. We're serious about fit and quality; we're playful about everything else.

### Smart, Not Snobby
We've done the research so you don't have to. We share what we know without being condescending. You're smart too—that's why you're here.

## PRODUCT PHILOSOPHY

### What Makes It TH8TA-Worthy

1. **Fit Test:** Does it accommodate athletic proportions? (Shoulders, lats, quads, length)
2. **Feel Test:** Does it feel distinctly different from workout gear? (No performance fabrics for loungewear)
3. **Form Test:** Does it celebrate the athletic body, not hide it?
4. **Quality Test:** Is the construction and material worth the price?
5. **Pairing Test:** Can we style it in unexpected, elevated ways?

### The Spectrum

TH8TA spans a wide range—all unified by the fit and feel philosophy:

```
CASUAL ←――――――――――――――――――――――――――――→ ELEVATED

Buttery leggings     →    Tailored joggers    →    Pleated trousers
Cropped muscle tank  →    Structured tee      →    Cashmere cardigan  
Slides               →    Clean sneakers      →    Puffer boots
Hoodie               →    Quarter-zip         →    Wool coat
```

Every piece: fits athletic bodies, signals rest, looks intentional.

## BRAND AESTHETIC

### Visual Language
- Clean, minimal, photography-forward
- Warm neutral palette (creams, oatmeal, charcoal, soft grays)
- Muted, desaturated lifestyle imagery
- Models with visible athletic builds (defined shoulders, lean muscle)
- Relaxed poses, never action shots
- Subtle athlete cues (tan lines, worn running shoes, race tattoos)

### The Vibe
Golden hour on rocks after a long run. Coffee in cashmere on Sunday morning. The airport lounge after a destination race. Dinner with friends—you look great but you're also secretly compressing.

- Charcoal (#2A2A2A) — text, headers
- Soft White (#FAFAFA) — backgrounds
- Warm Gray (#F2F0ED) — sections
- Dusty Lilac (#B8A9C9) — accents, CTAs (sparingly)

## THE 4-STAGE RECOVERY SYSTEM (Simplified)

We still organize products by recovery stage, but it's a navigation tool, not the brand identity.

| Stage | Name | The Moment | Examples |
|-------|------|------------|----------|
| 1 | Immediate Swap | Just finished, need to change | Quick-dry layers, the Rump Wrap™ |
| 2 | Shower & Soothe | Post-shower, peak relaxation | Buttery leggings, cashmere sets |
| 3 | Reintegrate | Back in the world, still recovering | Elevated joggers, structured tees |
| 4 | Reset | Evening wind-down, sleep | Sleep sets, ultra-soft everything |

**How we talk about it:** "Shop by stage" is a helpful filter. The hero message is about fit, feel, and form—not the system.

## COMPETITIVE POSITIONING

| Brand | What They Do | Why We're Different |
|-------|--------------|---------------------|
| Lululemon | Activewear + some lifestyle | We're purely afterwear; they're workout-first |
| Vuori | Athleisure for everyone | We're specifically built for athletic bodies |
| Alo Yoga | Fashion-forward yoga wear | We're sport-agnostic and recovery-focused |
| Tracksmith | Running culture lifestyle | We're post-run, not running-adjacent |
| Standard fashion brands | Clothes for average bodies | We fit athletes |

**Our whitespace:** Curated afterwear specifically for endurance athlete bodies. Nobody else is here.

### Homepage Hero
**Headline:** For bodies that train. For hours that don't.
**Subhead:** Curated afterwear for endurance athletes. Everything you wear when you're not working out—designed for the body you've built.
**CTA:** Shop the Collection

### About Section
You've spent thousands of hours building this body. The shoulders, the lats, the legs that carried you across finish lines. 

And nothing fits.

Fashion brands design for average. Athletic brands design for the workout. We design for the other 22 hours—when you're living in a body that trains, but you're not training.

TH8TA is curated afterwear for endurance athletes. If it's here, it fits you.

### Product Philosophy Section
**Headline:** We do the work so you don't have to.

Think Whole Foods for athletic afterwear. Instead of scouring brands and reading reviews, wondering if *this* cardigan will pull across your shoulders or *that* legging will feel like your training tights—just shop here.

Every piece passes the test:
- **Fits** athletic proportions (shoulders, lats, quads, length)
- **Feels** like rest, not work (no performance-fabric-brain-confusion)
- **Celebrates** the athletic form (no hiding under oversized everything)

### Category Intro: Leggings
**Headline:** Soft enough your brain knows you're off duty.

Your training tights are engineered for performance. Compression, wicking, speed. Your brain associates that feel with *work.*

These are different. Buttery. Unstructured. Zero performance pressure. Your nervous system gets the memo: you're done for the day.

(They also fit your quads without the weird knee bunching. You're welcome.)

### Category Intro: Tops
**Headline:** Room for the shoulders you built.

You know the problem. Standard tees pull across the lats. "Relaxed fit" is still tight in the wrong places. You end up in men's XL because nothing else works.

These fit. Space where you need it. Structure where it counts. Your athletic body, celebrated—not compressed or hidden.

## WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE

An endurance athlete finds TH8TA and thinks:

*"Finally. Someone gets it. These people understand my body, my life, and what I actually need when I'm not training. I can stop searching."*

They buy a cashmere cardigan that fits their shoulders. They pair it with a cropped muscle tank and feel like themselves—athletic, put-together, relaxed. They tell their training partners.

That's TH8TA.
