# TH8TA WEBSITE MESSAGING REFRESH
## Claude Code Prompt

---

## CONTEXT

We've refined TH8TA's brand positioning. The core insight has evolved:

**Before:** Recovery wear organized by a 4-Stage Recovery System
**After:** Curated afterwear for athletic bodies—everything you wear when you're not working out, designed for bodies that train

The 4-Stage System still exists as a shopping/navigation tool, but it's not the hero message anymore. The hero message is about **fit, feel, and form** for endurance athletes.

---

## THE REFRESH

Update the website copy to reflect this refined positioning. The design system, colors, and structure stay the same—we're just honing the messaging.

---

## KEY CHANGES

### 1. Homepage Hero

**REMOVE:**
```
H1: "You earned this layer."
Subtitle: "Not activewear. Afterwear. Curated recovery gear for endurance athletes."
```

**REPLACE WITH:**
```
H1: "For bodies that train. For hours that don't."
Subtitle: "Curated afterwear for endurance athletes. Everything you wear when you're not working out—designed for the body you've built."
CTA: "Shop the Collection"
Secondary: "Why fit matters →"
```

---

### 2. Homepage Problem Section

**REMOVE:** The paragraph about "saturation" and "gym-to-office crossover"

**REPLACE WITH:**
```
Section Title: "The Fit Problem Nobody Talks About"

Body:
"You've spent years building this body. The shoulders, the lats, the legs that carried you across finish lines.

And nothing fits.

Fashion brands design for average bodies. Athletic brands design for the workout. Nobody designs for the other 22 hours—when you're living in a body that trains, but you're not training.

That's what we're for."
```

---

### 3. Homepage Value Prop Section (NEW)

Add a new section after the problem section:

```
Section Title: "We do the work so you don't have to."

Body:
"Think Whole Foods for athletic afterwear. Instead of scouring brands, reading reviews, wondering if this cardigan will pull across your shoulders—just shop here. If it's on TH8TA, it passed the test."

Three columns:

Column 1:
Icon: [measuring tape or fit icon]
Title: "Fits Athletic Bodies"
Text: "Room in the shoulders. Space in the lats. Length in the torso. Every piece is tested on athletes."

Column 2:
Icon: [feather or soft cloud icon]
Title: "Feels Like Rest"
Text: "Buttery soft, not performance-tight. Your brain knows the difference. These signal: you're off duty."

Column 3:
Icon: [body silhouette or mirror icon]  
Title: "Celebrates the Form"
Text: "No hiding under oversized everything. Your athletic body, accentuated—not compressed or disguised."
```

---

### 4. The 4-Stage System Section

**Keep the 4 stages**, but reframe the intro:

**REMOVE:**
```
"You already know what to wear during your workout. We mapped everything after."
```

**REPLACE WITH:**
```
Section Title: "Shop by Recovery Stage"
Subtitle: "From the moment you finish to the minute you fall asleep—organized so you can find exactly what you need."
```

The stage cards stay the same:
- Stage 1: Immediate Swap — "Get dry. Get warm. Get moving."
- Stage 2: Shower & Soothe — "Peak comfort. Full relaxation."
- Stage 3: Reintegrate — "Back in the world. Still recovering."
- Stage 4: Reset — "Wind down. Sleep deep."

---

### 5. Featured Products Section

**REMOVE:** "Curator's Picks"

**REPLACE WITH:**
```
Section Title: "Tested on Athletes"
Subtitle: "Every piece passes our fit test. These are selling fast."
```

---

### 6. Science Teaser Section

**REMOVE:** 
```
"Your brain needs permission to stop being an athlete."
```

**REPLACE WITH:**
```
Section Title: "Why Soft Fabric Actually Matters"
Body: "Your training tights are engineered for performance. Your brain associates that feel with work. Our fabrics are intentionally different—so your nervous system knows you're done for the day."
CTA: "The Science of Afterwear →"
```

---

### 7. About Page Updates

**Hero headline:**
```
"For the other 22 hours."
```

**Section 1: Who We Are**
```
"TH8TA is curated afterwear for endurance athletes.

We're not activewear—you have enough of that. We're not athleisure—we hate that word. We're everything you wear when you're not working out, designed for bodies that do.

Tanks with room for lats. Leggings that feel like rest. Cashmere that drapes over muscle. The pieces that make you look like an athlete who has their shit together."
```

**Section 2: The Problem We Solve**
```
Title: "Nothing Fits Right"

"You know the drill. Standard tees pull across your lats. 'Relaxed fit' is still tight in the shoulders. Leggings feel like your training tights—your brain can't relax. You end up in oversized everything because nothing else works.

We fix that."
```

**Section 3: Our Philosophy**
```
Title: "We Do the Work"

"Think of us like Whole Foods did for organic. Instead of scouring every brand, reading every label, wondering if this piece will fit your shoulders—you just shop TH8TA.

Every piece passes the test:
• Fits athletic proportions
• Feels like rest, not work  
• Celebrates the athletic form
• Worth the price

If it's here, it works."
```

---

### 8. Product Category Intros

**Leggings/Joggers:**
```
Title: "Soft Enough Your Brain Knows You're Off Duty"
Body: "Your training tights are for performance. These are for everything after. Buttery, unstructured, zero compression pressure. Your nervous system gets the memo."
```

**Tops:**
```
Title: "Room for the Shoulders You Built"
Body: "Space in the lats. Length in the torso. Structure where it counts. Your athletic body, celebrated—not compressed into standard sizing."
```

**Sets:**
```
Title: "Matched for Maximum Chill"
Body: "Coordinated pieces that work together. Put on a set, feel put together, do absolutely nothing. That's the goal."
```

**Layers:**
```
Title: "Cashmere That Actually Fits"
Body: "Cardigans that don't pull across your back. Quarter-zips with shoulder room. The elevated pieces that work for athletic frames."
```

---

### 9. Footer Tagline

**REMOVE:** Any mention of "4-Stage Recovery System" in the footer

**ADD:** Small tagline above copyright:
```
"For bodies that train. For hours that don't."
```

---

### 10. Navigation Updates

Keep the structure, but update labels if needed:

```
Main Nav:
- Women
- Men  
- Shop by Stage (dropdown with 4 stages)
- The Science (replaces "The System")
- About

"The Science" page covers:
- Why afterwear matters
- The fit problem for athletes
- Nervous system / soft fabric science
- The 4-Stage system explained
```

---

## COPY PRINCIPLES

When writing any new copy, follow these rules:

1. **Lead with the athlete's problem, then our solution**
2. **"Athletic body" not "athletic build"** (body feels more embodied)
3. **"Afterwear" is our word** — use it consistently
4. **Avoid "athleisure"** — we hate that word, say so if needed
5. **Be specific about fit issues** (shoulders, lats, quads, length)
6. **"Your brain knows the difference"** — reference the nervous system casually
7. **Keep it warm and slightly irreverent** — we're friendly, not formal
8. **Don't over-explain the 4 stages** — it's a tool, not the identity

---

## TONE EXAMPLES

**Too formal:**
"Our garments are engineered to accommodate athletic proportions while signaling parasympathetic nervous system activation."

**Too casual:**
"Bro, your lats are huge and nothing fits lol we got you"

**Just right:**
"You didn't spend years building this body to hide it in oversized everything."

---

## PAGES TO UPDATE

1. **Homepage** — Hero, problem section, value props, featured products
2. **About page** — Full rewrite with new positioning
3. **The Science page** (formerly The System) — Reframe around fit/feel/form, keep stages as navigation tool
4. **Category pages** — Add new intro copy for each category
5. **Footer** — Add tagline, remove system-heavy language
6. **Navigation** — Rename "The System" to "The Science" or "Why It Matters"

---

## WHAT STAYS THE SAME

- All colors, typography, spacing (the design system)
- The 4-Stage concept (just demoted from hero to navigation tool)
- Product cards, layouts, general structure
- The minimal lilac-accent approach
- Photography style guidelines

---

## DELIVERABLES

After making these changes:
1. Show me the updated homepage
2. Show me the updated About page
3. Confirm navigation changes
4. List any copy that needs my review before finalizing

---

## THE NORTH STAR

Every piece of copy should make an endurance athlete think:

*"Finally. Someone gets it. These people understand my body and what I need when I'm not training."*

That's the vibe. Go.
